This data repository includes model code and data files used in the analysis presented in "The Importance of Monsoon Precipitation for Foundation Tree Species across the Semiarid Southwestern U.S." submitted to Frontiers in December 2022.

ModelCode: Contains a script for initializing and running the merged stem and soil isotope mixing model along with the model code. This code, script, and all data files should be stored in a single directory and run in OpenBugs.

DataFiles: The .odc data files are organized to be read into the OpenBugs model. Additionally, we have uploaded an Excel file that contains all of the data organized in a more intuitive structure.
